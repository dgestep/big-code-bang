# Big Code Bang

The Big Code Bang project is a tool that generates the code and project structure for the Model and View components of 
a web application.  A typical web application involves a database layer, an application logic layer, a REST service 
layer, security, and a view layer. Best practice suggests that each of these layers be decoupled in order to allow flexibility with 
regards to the implementation details. Big Code Bang generates the projects and code architected in a manner that can
 be built upon and adheres to best practices.  Run Big Code Bang and... bing bang boom, you have a runnable 
 application separated into two projects; one project containing your application/database logic and another project 
 containing your View logic.  Go ahead and give it a bang! :-)


**Note:** This project is almost done... Stay tuned, more to follow...
