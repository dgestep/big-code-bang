# Big Code Bang

A typical application involves a database layer, an application logic layer, a REST service layer, and a view 
layer. Best practice suggests that each of these layers be decoupled in order to allow flexibility with regards to 
the implementation details.

The Big Bang Code project was created to expedite the project setup and established an architecture that can be built
 upon.
